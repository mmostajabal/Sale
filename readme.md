# API Design and Implementation

## Project Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of an API for managing Customers and Orders. The API will support creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving customers and orders. It uses .NET 8.0, SQL Server, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and NUnit for unit testing. The design follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and employs the Repository and Unit of Work patterns.

## Assumptions

- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Framework:** .NET 8.0
- **Architecture:** CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Design Patterns:** Repository Pattern, Unit of Work Pattern
- **ORM:** Entity Framework
- **Testing Framework:** NUnit
- **containerize:** Docker

# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Overview

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the problem domain. The primary goal of DDD is to design and build software systems that reflect the complex realities of the business domain.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Domain**

The domain represents the primary focus of the business or problem area that the software is intended to address. It encompasses all relevant business processes, rules, and information.

### 2. **Bounded Context**

A Bounded Context defines a boundary within which a specific domain model is defined and applicable. It ensures that terms and concepts within that boundary are consistent and unambiguous.

### 3. **Entities**

Entities are objects that have a distinct identity and lifecycle. They are defined by their identity rather than their attributes. For example, a `Customer` entity is identified uniquely, often by an ID, and its identity persists over time.

# Application Layer in Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Overview

The Application Layer is responsible for orchestrating the application's use cases and managing interactions between the Domain Layer and external interfaces such as user interfaces and APIs. It handles commands and queries, ensures that domain logic is correctly applied, and manages transactions and validation.

## Responsibilities

1. **Orchestrating Use Cases**: Coordinates the application's use cases, handling operations like creating a customer or placing an order.

2. **Handling Commands and Queries**: Processes commands (to modify state) and queries (to retrieve state), often using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

3. **Interacting with Domain Layer**: Uses domain services, aggregates, and repositories to perform operations and enforce business rules.

4. **Managing Transactions**: Manages transactions across multiple domain objects, ensuring that changes are committed or rolled back as necessary.

5. **Validation and Mapping**: Validates input data and maps between DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and domain models.

6. **Security and Authorization**: Ensures that operations are performed by authorized users and adheres to security policies.

# Infrastructure and Persistence Layers in Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Overview

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the **Infrastructure Layer** and **Persistence Layer** are responsible for providing technical capabilities and persistence mechanisms necessary to support the Domain Layer and Application Layer. These layers handle data storage, communication with external systems, and other technical concerns.

## Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer provides support for cross-cutting concerns and technical functionalities that are needed by the application but are not part of the domain logic. It includes functionalities like data access, external integrations, logging, and communication.

### Responsibilities

1. **Data Access**: Implements repositories and provides mechanisms for querying and storing data.
2. **External Integrations**: Manages interactions with external systems, services, and APIs.
3. **Logging**: Provides mechanisms for logging application events and errors.
4. **Configuration**: Manages application settings and configurations.
5. **Messaging**: Handles messaging and event distribution systems, such as message queues or event buses.

# Shared Layer in Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Overview

The **Shared Layer** in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is used to manage common functionality and data structures that are shared across different layers or components of the application. One of the primary uses of the Shared Layer is to define **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**. DTOs are used for transferring data between layers, services, or even different applications.

## Responsibilities

1. **Define Data Structures**: Create data structures that are used for transferring data between the layers of the application.
2. **Separate Concerns**: Ensure that DTOs are separate from domain models to avoid exposing internal domain logic to other layers.
3. **Facilitate Communication**: Provide a standardized way of communicating data between different parts of the system, including APIs and external services.
4. **Reduce Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between layers by using DTOs to encapsulate data.
